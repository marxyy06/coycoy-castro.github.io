Since we are broken family, I only heard the story on my father's side. This is how the story begin. According to my Father, he was playing dart together with his best friends. Until he saw a beautiful girl watching over there. He approached my mom to know more about her as well as to get her cellphone number. They started to text each other. Until they fall in love.<p>
