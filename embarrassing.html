It was during my sophomore year in high school, and I was attending a school dance with my friends. I had been looking forward to the dance for weeks and had put a lot of effort into my outfit, hair, and makeup. I was feeling confident and ready to have a great time.

As the dance started, I joined my friends on the dance floor, dancing and laughing with them. I was having a blast, feeling like I was owning the dance moves and impressing my peers. At one point, a popular song came on, and I decided to break out my best dance moves.

I started dancing energetically, not realizing that I was dancing a little too close to the edge of the dance floor. As I went for a particularly enthusiastic move, I tripped over my own feet and stumbled off the dance floor, landing flat on my face in front of everyone.
